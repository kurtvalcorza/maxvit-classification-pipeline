"""Per-repository template for tools/build_notebook.py (NOTEBOOK_SPEC 2.2 §4 standalone carrier).

Only the task-specific prose and stage cells live here. Runtime install, the embedded package, and the
model pin/stage/verify cells are produced by the generator from repository sources so they cannot
drift from the package.

This is an `E2E` template, so it must state `run_all` itself, and its default path really adapts:
NOTEBOOK_SPEC 2.2 RUN7/FT2 make a bounded fine-tune mandatory rather than optional for this profile.
Every value a reader can change is a `# @param` form field, and each file-reading BYOD branch has a
location field that bypasses the upload dialog when set (EXE1, EXE2).

Review 2026-10-02 (MXV-M1..M4, MXV-m1..m3): the notebook runs in the fleet's uv isolated environment
(generator /2.1); the split keeps pixel-identical and near-duplicate images (the archive's darkened copies) on
one side (`assign_duplicate_groups` + `split_dataset(..., group_key="group")`, checked from the pixels by
`cross_split_duplicates`); the comparison says when it is at ceiling instead of claiming a fine-tune gain; the
fine-tune rebuilds the re-headed model before every run; the guided layer (audience, task contract, how to use,
roadmap, predictions, worked answers, a change-one-thing activity, troubleshooting, glossary, conclusion) is
present; and the BYOD dataset branch writes a result JSON with a reload check.

    "capability": "ImageNet-1k image classification with MaxViT-Tiny, a hybrid convolution and multi-axis attention network, and a bounded fine-tune that replaces the 1000-class head with one for your own classes, compares it on a held-out split with the majority-class and zero-shot ImageNet baselines, and exports a reloadable SafeTensors adapter",
    "intro": (
        "MaxViT (Multi-Axis Vision Transformer) is a hybrid network. Every block combines an MBConv convolution with two self-attention "
        "steps: **block attention** inside non-overlapping 7×7 windows, for local detail, and **grid attention** across a sparse 7×7 grid "
        "spanning the whole feature map, for global context. The Tiny model stacks such blocks in four stages behind a convolutional stem, "
        "about 30.9M parameters and 5.6 GMACs. The `timm/maxvit_tiny_tf_224.in1k` checkpoint was trained on ImageNet-1k by the paper authors in "
        "TensorFlow and ported to PyTorch in `timm`. Its head applies LayerNorm, a 512-wide Tanh layer and a linear layer that outputs a "
        "softmax over the 1000 ImageNet classes.\n\n"
        "**The input size is fixed.** Window and grid partitions need 224×224 inputs, so every image is resized (shorter side to 235 px, "
        "bicubic) and centre-cropped to 224×224 (`crop_pct` 0.95) before normalisation with the ImageNet mean and standard deviation.\n\n"
        "**The default path really adapts the model:** it downloads a pinned 400-image CIFAR-10 subset (`frog` and `truck`), groups the "
        "archive's duplicate and darkened copies so that no photograph lands on both sides of a split, measures two baselines on a held-out "
        "split — always answering the training majority, and mapping the ImageNet head's frog and truck classes to the two labels without any "
        "training — then replaces the head with a two-class layer, fine-tunes, scores the result on the same held-out split, classifies a "
        "further unseen split, exports the changed tensors as a SafeTensors adapter, and reloads that adapter onto a fresh copy of the verified "
        "base model to check that it reproduces the same predictions. Every number you see is measured in this notebook runtime. "
        "One result is worth knowing in advance: **frog versus truck is easy for this model.** The zero-shot ImageNet mapping already "
        "classifies 58 of the 60 held-out images correctly in the recorded run, so the fine-tune can gain at most two images, a difference "
        "the 95% intervals cannot separate; Section 9 says so in the reading it prints from the counts, and the notebook does not claim a "
        "fine-tuning gain it cannot measure. The lesson is the workflow, not a gain.\n\n"
        "**Who this is for.** A learner who knows basic Python and PIL and wants to see how a pretrained image classifier is re-headed and "
        "fine-tuned for new classes, and how the result is measured without fooling themselves: baselines first, a split that keeps copies "
        "of one photograph together, and an honest reading of a tie. No prior experience with MaxViT, attention, PyTorch training loops or fine-tuning "
        "is assumed; each term is explained where it is first used and again in the **Glossary** at the end.\n\n"
        "**Input → Model → Output.**\n\n"
        "| | Inference (ImageNet head) | Adaptation (two-class head) |\n"
        "|---|---|---|\n"
        "| Input | one RGB image, sides 8..4,096 px, and `TOP_K` | 280 labelled CIFAR-10 thumbnails (`frog`, `truck`, 32×32 px, upsampled to 224 px) |\n"

        "| Output | the `TOP_K` ImageNet labels with softmax scores, and a `sample-sanity` report | held-out accuracy and balanced accuracy next to three baselines, unseen-split predictions, and a SafeTensors adapter that reloads to the same predictions |\n\n"
        "**How to use this notebook.** Choose a runtime (a GPU runtime is much faster; CPU works), then **Runtime → Run all**. Sections 1–3 are "
        "**infrastructure** — the isolated environment, the carried code (collapsed) and the model verification — and can be run without study. "
        "The learning path starts in Section 4. Form fields (`# @param`) are the only values meant to be edited; the defaults reproduce the "
        "recorded path. Before Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 run you are asked to **predict** what they will print; the following section "
        "opens with **What to notice** and a collapsible **Check your reasoning** block with a worked answer from a recorded run. Section 8 "
        "always starts training from the freshly re-headed model, so re-running it after a change compares the new setting against the same "
        "starting point. Section 14 is a **change-one-thing activity**; it and each optional experiment name the field to change and the cell "
        "to re-run from (**Runtime → Run after**). **Troubleshooting**, a **Glossary** and a **Conclusion** template are at the end. Your notes "
        "are optional and are not required submissions.\n\n"
        "**Roadmap:** 4 download, verify and validate the sample, and group its copies → 5 split by group, ImageNet top-5 and the zero-shot "
        "baseline → 6 blank and noise probes → 7 re-head and measure the untrained head → 8 bounded fine-tune → 9 held-out comparison, and "
        "what a tie means → 10 unseen split → 11 export and reload the adapter → 12 outputs → 13 optional BYOD → 14 **change one thing: freeze "

        "→ a softmax over the head's classes* and read a top-5 list (Section 5); (2) explain why copies of one photograph must stay on one side "
        "of a split, and check it from the pixels (Sections 4–5); (3) build a zero-shot baseline by mapping ImageNet classes onto task labels, "
        "and say why it must be measured before any fine-tune (Section 5); (4) explain why a closed-set classifier labels a blank or noise "
        "image confidently (Sections 6 and 10); (5) say what an untrained head's score does and does not tell you (Section 7); (6) read a "
        "training loss as optimisation evidence and held-out accuracy as task evidence, and state what a tie at the ceiling shows (Sections "
        "8–9); (7) check that an exported adapter reproduces the evaluated model (Section 11); and (8) predict and then measure what freezing "
        "the backbone changes when both runs start from the same re-headed model (Section 14). Along the way the notebook builds a locked "

        "benchmark results (the tutorial uses two classes and a few hundred images); real-world frog or vehicle recognition (CIFAR-10 images are "
        "32×32 thumbnails, upsampled here to 224 px); open-set recognition or a reject option (every image receives one of the known classes); "

        "- **Runtime:** a fresh supported runtime (Google Colab, Kaggle or Linux Jupyter — **Linux x86_64 only**; the notebook builds its own isolated Python 3.12.12 environment, so a Windows or macOS kernel is not supported). A CUDA GPU such as a Colab or Kaggle T4 is recommended for the fine-tune and is used automatically when present; the notebook also runs on CPU, much more slowly. Measured, each figure with its environment: a Kaggle Tesla T4 run of the earlier in-kernel-install revision (notebook blob `b736baab`, 2026-09-26) took 322.8 s in two passes — 248.7 s until the install cell stopped for a restart, then 74.0 s for every cell after the restart, about 32 s of it the fine-tune; a local CPU run of this revision (Windows workstation, 2026-10-08, install skipped, files pre-staged, host shared with other jobs) took 656 s of cell time, 555 s of it the fine-tune. This revision's isolated-environment build has not yet been timed on a hosted runtime; expect it to add a few minutes (an estimate). The locked install (PyTorch 2.14.0 with its CUDA libraries) is the largest download; the checkpoint is about 124 MB.",

BYOD is optional and off by default. Expected BYOD input: one image, or a directory or `.zip` of class folders, `<class>/<image>`, with at least 2 classes and at least 2 images per class that are not copies of each other (more is better: 4 or more independent images per class also gives an unseen split). A `.tar` or other archive is not read; unpack it or re-zip it.",

        "fine-tune take more or less time? Write your guess next to row 0 of the Section 9 run history.\n"
        "2. **Change:** in Section 8 set `FREEZE_BACKBONE = True`. Change nothing else.\n"
        "3. **Run:** select the Section 8 cell and choose **Runtime → Run after**. Section 8 rebuilds the re-headed model from the verified "
        "snapshot before training (it prints `rebuilt_from_verified_snapshot`), Section 9 adds a row to the run history, and Sections 10–12 "
        "re-run on the new adapter. (If you re-run only the Section 8 cell, it still trains from the re-headed model; re-run Sections 9–12 "
        "afterwards so the comparison, the export and the outputs describe the same model.)\n"
        "4. **Observe:** in Section 8, `trainable_parameters` falls from every parameter to the head alone. In Section 9, compare rows 0 and "
        "1 of the run history: `fine_tuned_accuracy`, `zero_shot_accuracy`, `final_loss` and `train_seconds`. In Section 11, count the "
        "adapter's tensors.\n"
        "5. **Explain:** in one sentence, why can training under 1% of the parameters reach the same held-out accuracy as training all of "
        "them on this task?\n\n"
        "<details><summary>Check your reasoning</summary>In a local CPU run of this revision (2026-10-08, real weights, `FREEZE_BACKBONE = True` and Sections 8–11 re-run after the default run, every other field at its default) Section 8 printed `rebuilt_from_verified_snapshot`, trained 264,706 of 30,404,554 parameters (0.87%: the head's LayerNorm, its 512-wide Tanh layer and the new `fc`), and its losses went 0.5426 → 0.0813 (the full fine-tune: 0.3367 → 0.0015). Section 11 then exported 6 tensors and reloaded equivalently. The run history read: full fine-tune 60/60 held-out in 555.4 s; head only 60/60 [0.940, 1.000] in 179.5 s; zero-shot 58/60 in both rows. The pretrained features already separate frogs from trucks — the zero-shot row is near ceiling — so a small head on top of them gets all the way on this split in five short epochs, about three times faster on this CPU; the higher final loss says the head-only model is still less confident on the training images. A tie at 60/60 on 60 images does not rank the two settings; it says both are at the ceiling of this test.</details>\n\n"
        "## Interpretation and limits\n\n"
        "Start from your own run: the Section 9 table and its reading line, the Section 4 grouping summary and the Section 5 cross-split "
        "counts. Then read the reference answer.\n\n"
        "<details><summary>Reference answer from the recorded runs</summary>The ImageNet head gave the sample thumbnails non-frog, non-truck top-1 labels at 32 px, yet its summed frog and truck classes separated the two labels, and it spread its scores thinly over blank and noise images. The archive's 400 images are 200 photographs, each held twice; grouped, they split 280 / 60 / 60 with no copy across splits. On the 60 held-out images the zero-shot mapping scored 58/60 [0.886, 0.991]; the untrained head 21/60, which moves with the seed between 0.217 and 0.667; the full fine-tune and the head-only fine-tune both 60/60 [0.940, 1.000] — every interval overlaps the zero-shot one, so this run measures **no reliable fine-tuning gain** over what the pretrained model already does. The unseen split scored 60/60 and the adapter reloaded to the same predictions within 1e-4 (local CPU run of this revision, 2026-10-08; the Kaggle T4 run of the earlier revision, whose split was not duplicate-aware, scored zero-shot 1.000 and fine-tuned 1.000 there).</details>\n\n"
        "**What this notebook established, in this runtime.** The pinned `timm/maxvit_tiny_tf_224.in1k` snapshot was verified against a committed "
        "SHA-256 manifest before loading, and the pinned CIFAR-10 subset was verified against its recorded digest before it was read. Its "
        "duplicate and darkened copies were grouped, the split kept every group on one side, and the held-out and unseen splits were checked "
        "from the pixels to hold no copy of a training image. The ImageNet head was run on sample thumbnails and on two structure-free probes, "
        "and its frog and truck classes gave a zero-shot baseline. The head was then replaced for the two tutorial classes and fine-tuned, and "
        "the result was compared with the majority-class, zero-shot and untrained baselines on the same held-out split and checked on an unseen "
        "split. The adapter was exported, reloaded onto a fresh base model and checked against the in-memory predictions.\n\n"
        "**What the comparison shows.** On frog versus truck the pretrained model is already at or near ceiling: the zero-shot mapping "
        "classifies 58 of the 60 held-out images correctly without any training, and the fine-tune's 60 of 60 is a two-image difference "
        "inside overlapping 95% intervals. This run shows that the fine-tune *works* — it trains, it matches the zero-shot result with a "
        "dedicated two-class head, and it exports faithfully — but not that it *improves* on what the pretrained model already does. The untrained head's score is a property of a random starting point, not a floor that the fine-tune lifts the model from. "
        "Measuring a fine-tuning gain needs a task the pretrained head does not already solve: your own classes through the BYOD dataset branch, "
        "for example.\n\n"
        "**What a green run proves.** Successful execution proves that the recorded repository revision, the pinned dependency set, the pinned "
        "checkpoint and the pinned dataset together reproduce these stages in a fresh runtime, without the repository being cloned or installed "
        "and without any DIMER worker or service. It does **not** establish benchmark superiority, fitness for any deployment, or that the "
        "adapted model recognises frogs or trucks outside CIFAR-10's 32×32 thumbnails. The held-out scores come from a few dozen images and carry "
        "no dispersion estimate. The scores are not calibrated probabilities, and there is no reject option.\n\n"
        "**Reproducibility.** Seeds are form fields (`DATASET_SEED`, `SEED`), the run is float32 with no data augmentation, and the new head is "
        "initialised under `SEED`. GPU kernels are not forced to be deterministic, so repeated GPU runs can differ in the last digits of the loss "
        "and the scores.\n\n"
        "**More experiments (optional).** Each one names the field to change and where to re-run from; a re-run of Section 8 always starts "
        "from the re-headed model, and Section 9's run history keeps the earlier rows.\n\n"
        "- **A smaller sample:** set `PER_CLASS = 10` in Section 4, select Section 4 and choose **Runtime → Run after**. With 10 images per class the grouping finds 19 groups (one darkened pair), the split is 14 / 2 / 4, and the held-out split holds 2 images, so one image is worth 50 points of accuracy. In a local CPU run zero-shot scored 2/2, whose 95% Wilson interval is [0.342, 1.000], and the fine-tune trained on 14 images scored 1/2, interval [0.095, 0.905]: both intervals span most of the possible range, so neither score says much. Watch the interval, not the accuracy.\n"
        "- **A different starting point:** set `SEED = 1` in Section 5 and **Run after** from Section 5. The split, the untrained head and the "
        "fine-tune all change with it; compare how far the untrained row moves with how far the zero-shot and fine-tuned rows move.\n"
        "- **Your own classes:** turn on `USE_BYOD_DATASET` in Section 13 and re-run that cell only. Pick classes the ImageNet head does not "
        "already name, so the untrained-to-fine-tuned change has room to mean something.\n\n"
        "## Troubleshooting\n\n"
        "- **Section 1 stops with \"needs a Linux x86_64 runtime\".** The locked environment is built from manylinux wheels; use Google Colab, "
        "Kaggle or a Linux Jupyter server.\n"
        "- **Section 1 fails while downloading.** The `uv` wheel, the managed Python and the locked packages come from PyPI and "
        "python-build-standalone; run the cell again. A size or SHA-256 mismatch is refused on purpose — if it repeats, the download is being altered.\n"
        "- **A restart prompt.** This notebook never needs one: nothing is installed into the kernel. If the isolated process exits (usually out "
        "of memory), restart the session and choose **Run all**.\n"
        "- **Section 3 or 4 stops on a download or a digest mismatch.** The checkpoint and the sample archive are fetched from the Hugging Face "
        "Hub at pinned revisions and re-hashed; a mismatch is never loaded. Run the cell again; if it repeats, delete `weights/` or `data/` and "
        "run from that section.\n"
        "- **Section 5 stops with \"copies of one photograph straddle the split\".** The split was made without `group_key='group'` or before "
        "Section 4 grouped the records; run from Section 4.\n"
        "- **Out of memory in Section 8.** Lower `BATCH_SIZE` to 8 in Section 8, or set `FREEZE_BACKBONE = True`, and **Run after** from "
        "Section 8. On a CPU runtime the fine-tune is slow, not broken.\n"
        "- **Section 11 stops with \"the export does not reproduce the evaluated model\".** The model in memory was changed after it was "
        "evaluated; re-run from Section 8 (**Runtime → Run after**).\n"
        "- **BYOD is refused.** Each refusal names the rule: fewer than 2 class folders, a class with fewer than 2 independent images, a path "
        "with `..`, an undecodable image, an image side outside 8..4,096 px, a file that is not a directory or a `.zip`, or an empty location "
        "outside Colab. Fix the input or the location field, then re-run Section 13.\n\n"
        "## Glossary\n\n"
        "- **MaxViT / MBConv / block and grid attention:** a hybrid network whose every block applies an MBConv convolution (a 1×1 "
        "convolution that widens the channels, a depthwise convolution that filters each channel, squeeze-and-excitation and a 1×1 "
        "convolution that narrows them again), then self-attention inside non-overlapping 7×7 windows (**block attention**, local detail) "
        "and self-attention across a sparse 7×7 grid that spans the whole feature map (**grid attention**, global context). The last stage "
        "ends in 512 channels, averaged into the vector the head reads through LayerNorm and a 512-wide Tanh layer.\n"
        "- **BatchNorm running statistics:** the per-channel mean and variance a BatchNorm layer stores during training and uses at "
        "inference; a head-only fine-tune keeps these layers in evaluation mode so the frozen backbone stays exactly the base checkpoint.\n"
        "- **Softmax score:** the head's output turned into numbers that sum to 1 over its classes; the label is the largest. Not a calibrated "
        "probability, and never \"none of these\".\n"

        "label; no weight changes.\n"
        "- **Re-heading:** replacing the 1000-class layer with a freshly initialised one for the task's classes.\n"
        "- **Duplicate group:** records that are pixel-identical or near duplicates of one photograph; a split keeps each group on one side.\n"
        "- **Held-out split:** images never shown to the optimizer, never used to choose a setting, and with no copy in the training split; "
        "the task evidence.\n"
        "- **Accuracy / balanced accuracy:** the fraction answered correctly, and the mean of the per-class recalls.\n"
        "- **At ceiling:** a baseline already scores (nearly) every test image correctly, so no method can measurably beat it on that test set.\n"
        "- **Cross-entropy / AdamW:** the training loss for one label per image, and the optimizer that minimises it with decoupled weight decay.\n"
        "- **Adapter / reload equivalence:** the SafeTensors file of the tensors the fine-tune changed, and the check that a fresh base "
