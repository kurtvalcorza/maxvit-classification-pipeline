drift from the package.

    "intro": (
        "MaxViT (Multi-Axis Vision Transformer) is a hybrid network. Every block combines an MBConv convolution with two self-attention "
        "steps: **block attention** inside non-overlapping 7×7 windows, for local detail, and **grid attention** across a sparse 7×7 grid "
        "spanning the whole feature map, for global context. The Tiny model stacks such blocks in four stages behind a convolutional stem, "
        "about 30.9M parameters and 5.6 GMACs. The `timm/maxvit_tiny_tf_224.in1k` checkpoint was trained on ImageNet-1k by the paper authors in "
        "TensorFlow and ported to PyTorch in `timm`. Its head applies LayerNorm, a 512-wide Tanh layer and a linear layer that outputs a "
        "softmax over the 1000 ImageNet classes.\n\n"
        "**The input size is fixed.** Window and grid partitions need 224×224 inputs, so every image is resized (shorter side to 235 px, "
        "bicubic) and centre-cropped to 224×224 (`crop_pct` 0.95) before normalisation with the ImageNet mean and standard deviation.\n\n"
        "**The default path really adapts the model:** it downloads a pinned 400-image CIFAR-10 subset (`frog` and `truck`), measures two "
        "baselines on a held-out split — always answering the training majority, and mapping the ImageNet head's frog and truck classes to the "
        "two labels without any training — then replaces the head with a two-class layer, fine-tunes, scores the result on the same held-out "
        "split, classifies a further unseen split, exports the changed tensors as a SafeTensors adapter, and reloads that adapter onto a fresh "
        "copy of the verified base model to check that it reproduces the same predictions. Every number you see is measured in this notebook "

        "SHA-256 manifest before loading, and the pinned CIFAR-10 subset was verified against its recorded digest before it was read. The "
        "ImageNet head was run on sample thumbnails and on two structure-free probes, and its frog and truck classes gave a zero-shot baseline. "
        "The head was then replaced for the two tutorial classes and fine-tuned, and the result was compared with the majority-class, zero-shot "
        "and untrained baselines on the same held-out split and checked on an unseen split. The adapter was exported, reloaded onto a fresh base "
        "model and checked against the in-memory predictions.\n\n"
        "**What a green run proves.** Successful execution proves that the recorded repository revision, the pinned dependency set, the pinned "
        "checkpoint and the pinned dataset together reproduce these stages in a fresh runtime, without the repository being cloned or installed "
        "and without any DIMER worker or service. It does **not** establish benchmark superiority, fitness for any deployment, or that the "
        "adapted model recognises frogs or trucks outside CIFAR-10's 32×32 thumbnails. The held-out scores come from a few dozen images and carry "
        "no dispersion estimate. The scores are not calibrated probabilities, and there is no reject option.\n\n"
        "**Reproducibility.** Seeds are form fields (`DATASET_SEED`, `SEED`), the run is float32 with no data augmentation, and the new head is "
        "initialised under `SEED`. GPU kernels are not forced to be deterministic, so repeated GPU runs can differ in the last digits of the loss "
        "and the scores.\n\n"
        "**Try next.** Set `FREEZE_BACKBONE = True` and compare the held-out scores and runtime of a head-only fine-tune, or lower `PER_CLASS` "
        "and watch how quickly the fine-tuned model falls back toward the zero-shot baseline. To transfer the workflow, point `BYOD_DATASET_PATH` "
