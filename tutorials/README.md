Notebook specification: **DIMER Notebook Specification 2.1**. The notebook is **standalone** (§4) and declares its profile and pedagogical mode (§3.4). `tools/build_notebook.py` generates it from `tools/notebook_template.py`, and it carries the package's modules, the model identity, the snapshot manifest and the runtime pins, so the exported `.ipynb` works without this repository. Do not edit the notebook by hand: edit the package or the template and regenerate (`python tools/build_notebook.py`; CI and the validator enforce `--check`).

| Notebook | Profile | Mode | Carrier | Capability | Default runtime | Sample | BYOD | Run-all | Release status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `maxvit_classification_colab.ipynb` | `E2E` | `GUIDED` | standalone (generated) | ImageNet-1k classification with `timm/maxvit_tiny_tf_224.in1k`, and a bounded fine-tune of a new two-class head, compared on a held-out split with majority-class and zero-shot ImageNet baselines by accuracy and balanced accuracy, checked on an unseen split, and exported and reloaded as a SafeTensors adapter | CUDA GPU (T4 class) documented; CPU also runs | automatic (pinned `Cleanlab/cifar-10-subset` archive, SHA-256 verified; `frog` and `truck`) | single image, or a directory or `.zip` of class folders, off by default; location fields `BYOD_IMAGE_PATH`, `BYOD_DATASET_PATH`; uploads stay in the runtime | not yet run — the snapshot is not yet pinned; see `../docs/release-verification.md` | **Candidate** |

## Conformance notes

- **Standalone carrier (§4):** the default path performs no clone, repository install or repository import. Section 2 carries `data.py` and `pipeline.py` verbatim in dependency order (tagged `metadata.dimer.embedded_module`; the only rewrite makes the default weights directory working-directory-relative). Section 3 carries the model identity and the manifest inline and asserts that they agree with the module before anything is fetched. Section 1 carries the exact `pyproject.toml` runtime pins.
- **Parity (PAR1–PAR3):** `tests/test_notebook_parity.py` and `tools/validate_release_assets.py` fail when a carried module, the inline manifest or the inline pins differ from the repository, or when the notebook differs from the generator's output.
- **Model acquisition (MOD1–MOD8):** while the snapshot is not yet pinned, `stage_missing_files`, `verify_snapshot` and `from_pretrained` raise before any download. Once pinned, `stage_missing_files(WEIGHTS_DIR, allow_download=True)` fetches only the absent manifest entries at the immutable revision, `verify_snapshot` re-hashes every entry, and `from_pretrained(weights_dir=WEIGHTS_DIR)` builds the architecture with `timm.create_model(..., pretrained=False)` and loads the verified SafeTensors file with `strict=True`.
- **Data acquisition (DAT):** `fetch_sample_archive` downloads the sample at a fixed dataset commit and checks its size and SHA-256 before `read_class_archive` opens it; there is no fallback to other data.
- **Stages:** `validate_inputs` writes the input manifest, including one rejection finding from the `top_k=0` probe; `evaluation_report` writes the `sample-sanity` report for the ImageNet top-k predictions; `validate_dataset` validates the records; `zero_shot_evaluate` and the untrained head give the baselines; `evaluate` scores the held-out and unseen splits after `finetune`; `save_artifact` writes `outputs/maxvit_adapter.safetensors`; `load_artifact` rebuilds from the verified base and the adapter, and the notebook compares predictions within a stated tolerance.
- **Scores (UNC1–UNC4):** every `score` is a softmax value over the head's classes, not a calibration for the reader's images, and the label is the argmax: there is no threshold and no reject option, which the blank and noise probes make visible.
- **Non-interactive execution (EXE1–EXE4):** seeds, schedule, threshold, BYOD switches and BYOD locations are form fields; outputs go to `outputs/` under the working directory.
- `tools/validate_release_assets.py` performs source validation only. It does not satisfy the clean-runtime execution requirement; a release review must confirm that a recorded clean run in `docs/release-verification.md` matches the notebook revision under review before the status is promoted to `Release-grade`.

## AI Assistance Disclosure

This repository’s code and accompanying documentation were developed with generative AI assistance for code development and technical writing under maintainer direction. The maintainer remains responsible for reviewing the implementation, validating results, and making release decisions. AI assistance does not constitute independent verification, provider endorsement, or release approval.
